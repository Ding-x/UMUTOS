This system will be a significant benefit to university students. Comparing with traditional bookstores, UMUTOS is not limited by space and therefore can provide an infinite number of books to select from. UMUTOS simplifies purchase procedure, allowing customers to make purchases wherever they are. It also introduced many efficient ways for customers easily find a book. Such as searching its title, author or shop by book subjects. What’s more, UMUTOS offers both sellers and customers the opportunity to view feedbacks from previous customers. These feedbacks can provide a reference to customers of the seller's reputation and guide them during the selection. 

To be considered as successful, UMUTOS should achieve the following criterias. Firstly, the majority (i.e. over a half) of potential users should prefer to buy and sell used textbooks on UMUTOS rather than physical bookstore on campus. This comparison will be conducted by counting customers flow in physical bookstore and on UMUTOS. Secondly, we will also analysis the used textbook inventory of physical bookstore and UMUTOS, that is, users should be more easily to find the used textbook that they want on UMUTOS. Thus, the inventory of different kinds of used textbooks on UMUTOS should be obviously larger (i.e. over two times) than physical bookstore. Lastly, during each year, the number of new registered users should be more than 20 percent of the number of overall students on campus.
